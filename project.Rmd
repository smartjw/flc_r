A recent article in Scientific American entitled “You Can’t Handle the Truth–At Least on Twitter” describes a recent study of Twitter users’ response to fake news. First, read the article. Then, in 250-300 words, outline the challenges outlined in the article related to how to detect and control fake news in an age of social media use.'
