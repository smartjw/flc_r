## What will my data look like?  
I'm interested in knowing what effects writing center use has on student writing.  So, for this project, I've collected participants' writing before they began courses at Wake (via the Directed Self Placement), data on how frequently they use the writing center, and an essay they completed in Writing 111 (the same essay task for all participants).  To analyze the essay, I'm using the web-based tool Coh-Metrix ().  In the future, I'd like to open, read, and count features in the text files directly with R.  For my project, each participant has a userid that identifies the semester they completed Writing 111 and their first language. The text analysis data is currently stored in a csv file, where the userids are columns and the text analysis features are the rows.  

## Tidying my data

I've been reading through the tidydata information, and it seems to make sense, but I've just starte converting my data.  Here's the print of the word count for each of the DSP essays: 

        #ID feature
1      Label   DESWC
2  f18eng001     266
3  f18eng002     280
4  f18eng003     300
5  f18eng004     388
6  f18eng005     296
7  f18eng006     320
8  f18eng007     269
9  f18eng008     267
10 f18eng009     301
11 f18ger010     250
12 f18chi011     234
13 f18chi012     277
14 f18chi013     256
15 f18chi014     252
16 f18chi015     314
17 f18chi016     260
18 f18chi017     300
19 f18chi018     285
20 f18chi019     297
21 f18chi020     263
22 f18chi021     302

There are multiple features I would like to look at for each text (and a total of 70+ generated by the analysis), so I need to figure out the best way to address this with tidydata.
