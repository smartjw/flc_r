This website is where I drop all my miscellaneous debris from my work with the WFU faculty learning community on R.  I'm slowly working through learning R while trying to work on a small research project to measure the writing development of first-year undergraduates.  

## About me

I teach in the Writing Program at Wake Forest University. My background is in Applied Linguistics.
