##But is it Art?
This is a first-year seminar I co-teach with three other faculty members.  In the course, we work as a community of learners to address questions of how to define art and how art is judged and valued.  The students in the course usually keep a [blog](http://questioningartwfu.blogspot.com) of their work and experiences.
